# Hyd_Traffic_Analysis
Traffic Insights Dashboard | Power BI + Excel + Pandas

This project analyzes traffic data to uncover key patterns and build an interactive dashboard for better decision-making. The dataset was cleaned and pre-processed in Excel, explored using Pandas, and finally visualized in Power BI.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to understand traffic behavior by analyzing:

Total vehicle count over time

Peak traffic hours

Vehicle-type distribution

Day-wise / location-wise trends

This dashboard helps identify where and when congestion is most likely to occur.
